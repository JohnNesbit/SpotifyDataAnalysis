# SpotifyDataAnalysis
Script that fetches popularity data for a certain time frame per genre using spotipy.
Just threw it together one evening bc I wanted to see what genres were most popular with numerical values.
To get the data yourself you can go in the file and put your own client secret + id in the files + your own time range.
